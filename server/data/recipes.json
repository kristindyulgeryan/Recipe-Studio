(Or you can also use an oven – but not as crispy)\nTo make this super easy I steam the broccoli first in an Instant Pot (but you can also boil water, place broccoli in steamer basket and steam it for about 3 minutes).\nTo use the Instant Pot – place broccoli florets in the Instant Pot in a basket or piled high on a rack, add 1 cup of water. Pressure cook on high 0 minutes – yes 0 minutes. After button pops up, and right before it turns to 0, release steam immediately – otherwise broccoli will overcook. If your instant pot doesn't go to 0 minutes, put it on low pressure for 1 minute. Do quick release.\nPlace broccoli on air fryer basket. I like to use the air fryer parchment sheets but you don't have to. Use a large glass and smash down broccoli – flattening each floret. Drizzle/spray with oil, sprinkle Casa M Texas Twister over top, sprinkle grated Parmesan over all. Air fry for about 10-11 minutes until cheese has melted. You could also bake these for about 12 minutes, flipping over at the halfway mark.",
